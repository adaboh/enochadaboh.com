    <h3 class="h3-secondary">Welcome/About </h3>
    <p>
      Let's start with one of my favorite quote, "Life is an ongoing process
      and journey of self discovery". </p>
    <p> Hi there, My name is Enoch Kweku (Kay) Adaboh - just a normal guy trying to live and not to make a living.
      <span class="d-inline">I am an Information Technology Specialist and aspiring to get into the cybersecurity space. </span>
      My career did not begin working with computers. I started as a high school Mathematics and Economics teacher back in my home country-Ghana after graduating from the <a class="uses__link" href="https://ucc.edu.gh/" target="_blank">University of Cape Coast</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      However, life processes happened and I discovery a true passion for
      computers and working with it when I got my first personal laptop in my
      third year undergraduate studies so invariably am a late comer into IT but
      that has never been an obstacle towards this jorney.
    </p>
    <!--  -->
    <div class="about__readmore" s id="about__readmore" style="display: none;">
      <p>
        I developed and
        continue to develop my IT technical skills and knowledge through perservarance, hard work and most importantly
        self-teaching myself things I find interesting and have a passion for. I designed and built this website from scratch.

        All things being equal, I would prefer the use of terminal to accomplish a task over GUI. I love to code, to script and to automate things whenever possible.
      </p>

      <p>In my free time, I
        enjoy reading, watching live soccer games especially games involving my soccer -
        team Liverpool and listening to podcasts.
        I currently work full-time and in a hybrid role as an Information Technology Specialist with <a class="uses__link" href="https://cps.com/">Comprehensive Pharmacy Solutions - CPS</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am committed to contributing my quota in making the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have excellent work ethics because I put my heart into everything I do and I look forward to new chanlleging
        opportunities. This is part of my story, get in touch and let's add more chapters to it.
