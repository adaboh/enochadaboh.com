I started as a high school Mathematics and Economics teacher back in my home country-Ghana after graduating from the <a class="uses__link" href="https://ucc.edu.gh/" target="_blank">University of Cape Coast</a></p><p>However, life processes happened and I discovery a true passion for computers and working with it when I got my first personal laptop in my third year undergraduate studies so invariably am a late comer into IT but that has never been an obstacle towards this jorney.</p><div class="about__readmore" s id="about__readmore" style="display:none"><p>I developed and continue to develop my IT technical skills and knowledge through perservarance, hard work and most importantly self-teaching myself things I find interesting and have a passion for. I designed and built this website from scratch. All things being equal, I would prefer the use of terminal to accomplish a task over GUI. I love to code, to script and to automate things whenever possible.</p><p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching live soccer games especially games involving my soccer - team Liverpool and listening to podcasts. I currently work full-time and in a hybrid role as an Information Technology Specialist with <a class="uses__link" href="https://cps.com/">Comprehensive Pharmacy Solutions - CPS</a></p><p>I am committed to contributing my quota in making the world a better place.</p><p>I have excellent work ethics because I put my heart into everything I do and I look forward to new chanlleging opportunities. This is part of my story, get in touch and let's add more chapters to it.</p></div><button class="button-primary form__control button-readmore" type="submit" aria-label="Read More">Read More</button><h3 class="h3-secondary">Read/Reading</h3><p class="read-p">These are some the books I have read or reading over the past years!</p><ul class="books"><li class="books__list book1"><a href="#!" class="book__title link-hove">Not A Fan</a></li><li class="books__list book2"><a href="#!" class="book__title link-hoverty">Cert Guide: CompTIA A+</a></li><li class="books__list book3"><a href="#!" class="book__title link-hoverty">Mentality Monsters</a></li><li class="books__list book4"><a href="#!" class="book__title link-hoverty">The Book Of Mysteries</a></li><li class="books__list book5"><a href="#!" class="book__title link-hoverty">Linux Cmd Line & Shell Scripting</a></li><li class="books__list book6"><a href="#!" class="book__title link-hoverty">JavaScript For Kids</a></li><li class="books__list book7"><a href="#!" class="book__title link-hoverty">Ali A Life</a></li></ul></main><script defer="defer" src="vendor.31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c.js"></script><script defer="defer" src="main.291dcb7db267aa67a994.js"></script></body></html>
